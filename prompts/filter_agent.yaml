  description: >
    Analyze a the string: {input}. 
    
    Based *only* on the title and links, evaluate if the post likely falls into one of the priority categories:
      
        1.  **Core AI Models & Research:** Posts announcing or discussing new AI models (LLMs, diffusion models, etc.), significant model updates, influential research papers (e.g., from arXiv, top conferences), novel techniques, architectures, or state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark results.
               *Keywords/Signals:* OpenAI, Google AI/DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta AI, Mistral, Cohere, arXiv, paper, model, LLM, diffusion, transformer, SOTA, benchmark, new technique, research, study.
        2.  **AI Industry & Ecosystem News:** Major product launches, significant funding rounds for AI companies, acquisitions, key partnerships, major policy/regulation impacting AI, or important news from leading AI players.
               *Keywords/Signals:* Launch, release, funding, acquired, partnership, regulation, policy, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, etc. (as context suggests significance).
        3.  **AI Tools, Frameworks & Datasets:** "Show HN" or other posts introducing potentially high-impact open-source AI libraries, developer tools, platforms, significant framework updates (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.), or valuable new datasets for AI training/evaluation.
               *Keywords/Signals:* Show HN, open source, library, framework, tool, platform, dataset, release, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, LangChain, LlamaIndex.
        4.  **AI-Relevant Hardware & Infrastructure:** News or announcements about GPUs, TPUs, AI accelerators, chips specifically designed/marketed for AI workloads, or significant cloud infrastructure updates tailored for AI.
               *Keywords/Signals:* GPU, NVIDIA, TPU, AMD, Intel, chip, accelerator, hardware, inference, training, CUDA, cloud AI.

        **Exclusions:** 
    Do *not* flag posts that are merely tutorials on basic concepts, general programming discussions that tangentially mention AI, 
    opinion pieces without new information, minor bug fixes, simple questions, or personal projects unless the title/URL 
    strongly suggests broad impact or novelty within the AI field.
