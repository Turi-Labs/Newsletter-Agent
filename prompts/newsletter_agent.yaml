task:
  description: >
    Using the provided research notes, create an **ultra-brief daily AI news headlines** designed for a **30-second scan**.
    Your process must involve:
        1.  **Extreme Filtering:** Identify AI news, model launches, breakthroughs, product launches,
            discussions or strategic moves from the notes. Sort them based on the importance (launches, breakthroughs, AI news)
            Discard minor updates or excessive detail.
        2.  **Headline Format:** Each item should be a punchy headline of 10-15 words maximum. Include links where available.
        3.  **Structure:**
            *   Start with a short welcome message.
            *   Present the main news items as bullet points, ensuring each point is concise and impactful. 
                Add links (markdown syntax, ex: [Read More](link))
            *   End with a one-sentence "Quick Takeaway" that captures the overall direction.
        4.  **Style:** Write like newspaper headlines - direct, impactful, and information-dense. Keep it simple and stupid.
        5.  **Formatting:** Use markdown for readability (bolding key terms/names, bullet points).

        **Constraint:** The entire newsletter must be scannable in 30 seconds or less. Think of it as AI news in headline form only.

      - Main News Bullets: Each point extremely brief along with the link.
      - Quick Takeaway: (1-2 sentences summarizing the day's essence).
      - End Message: Something like this - Stay Updated: Follow us for daily insights into the fast-paced world of AI! Keep innovating, The TuriLabs Newsletter Team

    The output must be significantly condensed compared to the raw notes, focusing only on the absolute highlights 
    to strictly adhere to the 1-2 minute read time.
