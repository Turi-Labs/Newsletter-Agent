Today's AI Innovations: 2-Minute Update
Welcome to your rapid brief on today's key AI moves, designed for a quick read.

- **OpenAI's New Audio**: Launched advanced, cost-effective Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models (TTS ~ $0.015/min) based on GPT-4o, offering better voice control but still missing features like word timestamps.
- **Claude Gets Web Access**: Anthropic's Claude can now search the web in real-time (initially for paid US users), improving its handling of current technical questions and competing with other web-enabled LLMs.
- **AI Defamation Risk**: A ChatGPT incident highlights the ongoing challenge of AI generating false information, emphasizing the need for real-time verification and careful data governance to meet legal standards like GDPR.
- **Developer & 3D Tools**: Notable releases include 'Grease' for finding binary code bugs, and two rapid 3D model generators: Hunyuan3D-2-Turbo (near-instant results) and Bolt3D (fast 3D scenes from photos).
- **Open Source & Debugging**: Orpheus-3B offers an open-source emotive TTS option. OpenAI also quietly released o1-pro, a powerful (but expensive) API endpoint optimized for deep code debugging with a large context window.
- **Strategic Acquisition**: SoftBank is acquiring chip designer Ampere Computing for $6.5B, strengthening its position in server technology.

**Quick Takeaway**: Major players are enhancing core capabilities (audio, web search), while new tools emerge for developers and 3D creation. Legal/ethical challenges and strategic industry consolidation continue.
